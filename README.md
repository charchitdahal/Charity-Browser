I have developed an Android app called Charity Browser that blocks advertisements, removes
cookies and deletes your browser history after your session is done. This is the premium version
of the app. The free version of the app shows you advertisements with an option to remove them
if you upgrade to premium. All the earnings made from the ads or premium sales is donated to
the charity of your choice at the end of the month.
Charity is big in today’s world. People want to give back to the community in various ways:
some donate to Red Cross while some cater from Even Stevens. Tech Industry has picked up the
trend and has introduced various programs and application to give back the community. There
are programs like IBM's Smarter Planet Charity Run and Amazon Smile Program. However,
there are only a few applications that are out there to promote Philanthropy. I wanted Charity
Browser to be a first of its kind web browser to allow it’s user to start their philanthropy journey
just be browsing the web. I am planning on developing this in Android with a stretch goal of
releasing for IOS as well. I used the existing chromium-browser as starter code. I developed the
app in short iterations by adding features in each phase. Using this agile methodology also
allowed me to test and document the application in phases
